# Stack In Javascript

We had discussed about [Linked List In Javascript](https://namitamalik.github.io/Linked-list-in-Javascript/) in the previous blog. In this post
we would be discussing about another data structure i.e. **Stack**.

A **Stack** can logically be thought of as a real-life stack/pile where insertion/removal take place from one end. Stack is LIFO i.e. 
Last In First Out which means that last inserted element is removed first.

**Stack** basically has two methods:
1. **push()** - For inserting a element.
2. **pop()** - For removing and reading the removed element.

Let's see some action now.

We are taking a **Node** class, as given below:
```ECMA6
class Node {
    constructor(){
        this.data = undefined;
        this.previous = undefined;
    }
}
```

Now, let's move on to the **Stack** class, which will have **push()** and **pop()** methods.
```ECMA6
class Stack{
    constructor(){
        this.root = undefined;
    }

    push() {
        //To Be Implemented
    }

    pop() {
        //To Be Implemented
    }
}
```

1. **Push**: Push method does the following in order to insert a node to the Stack:
    
    1. Initializes the stack with root node when the first node is being inserted.
    2. When a new insertion happens, the new node is assigned to the root node and the previous root node starts pointing to the new root node.
    
    Hence our pretty simple **push()** looks like this:
    ```ECMA6
    push(value) {
        let node = new Node();
        node.data = value;
        if (!this.root) {
            this.root = node;
            this.root.previous = null;
        } else {
            node.previous = this.root;
            this.root = node;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Pop**: Pop method does the following in order to delete a node from the Stack:
    
    1. If there is no root node, that means that stack is empty and nothing needs to be done.
    2. In case there are node(s) in stack, then the previous node of the current root node can be assigned to the root and the old root node would now be up for garbage collectiom.
    
    Here is the **pop()** method:
    ```ECMA6
    pop() {
        if (this.root) {
            let temp = this.root;
            this.root = this.root.previous;
            return temp.data;
        }
    }
    ```

Now, our implementation for **Stack** is complete, but we still need a **print()** method, let's quickly implement it:
```ECMA6
print() {
    let temp = this.root;
    let result = [];
    while (temp) {
        result.push(temp.data);
        temp = temp.previous;
    }
    console.log(result.join(' => '));
}
```

Here is how the complete code would look like:
```ECMA6
class Node {
    constructor() {
        this.data = undefined;
        this.previous = undefined;
    }
}

class Stack {
    constructor() {
        this.root = undefined;
    }

    push(value) {
        let node = new Node();
        node.data = value;
        if (!this.root) {
            this.root = node;
            this.root.previous = null;
        } else {
            node.previous = this.root;
            this.root = node;
        }
    }

    pop() {
        if (this.root) {
            let temp = this.root;
            this.root = this.root.previous;
            return temp.data;
        }
    }

    print() {
        let temp = this.root;
        let result = [];
        while (temp) {
            result.push(temp.data);
            temp = temp.previous;
        }
        console.log(result.join(' => '));
    }
}
```

Let's test if the code works:
```ECMA6
var stack = new Stack();
stack.push('l');
stack.push('a');
stack.push('l');
stack.push('a');
stack.print(); // a => l => a => l
stack.pop();
stack.print(); //l => a => l
```

Now, many of you might have a thought when in Javascript, we have a **Array** that has **push** and **pop** methods, why to do so much of hard work.

Well, in **Javascript** even though we have **push** and **pop** methods, we have other methods as well like **shift()**, **unshift()**, **join()**, hence it is not purely a stack.
So, let's create a stack using array. The idea is to have an array assigned to a private variable with only **push** and **pop** methods exposed:

```ECMA6
function StackByArray() {
    let arr = [];
    this.push = push;
    this.pop = pop;
    this.print = print;

    function push(node) {
        arr.push(node)
    }

    function pop() {
        arr.pop();
    }

    function print() {
        console.log(arr.join(' => '))
    }
}
```

Let's test the code:
```ECMA6
let stackByArr = new StackByArray();
stackByArr.push('l');
stackByArr.push('a');
stackByArr.push('l');
stackByArr.push('a');
stackByArr.print();
stackByArr.pop();
stackByArr.print();
```

One can use any of the above mentioned implementations. 

A very common example where **Stack** data structure is used is the undo/redo mechanism. In this case all text changes are kept in the stack. Another common example is the **Back** button
of your browser. When a user navigates between the pages, navigated urls are stored in the form of **Stack**. Well, there are many more use cases... think about them!
